# dustmod zsh theme

Started with fixes, improvements and modifications to the nice and clean [**dst** theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/dst.zsh-theme). In the end it became yet another fully featured zsh theme.

Features are:
- the usual username, host, current directory in prompt
- different color and prompt for `root` user
- neutral color theme with info and prompt split on 2 lines to allow for enough space for info and commands
- git status. branch-name, repository status in verbose or symbols only
- clock
- return code of last command if it was not 0. translates the return code to a human readable error message
- duration of command for long running commands, i.e. > 20seconds

## Requirements
Needs **Python** installed to translate the return error codes

## Preview
*TODO*: add screenshots
